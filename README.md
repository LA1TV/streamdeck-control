# Elagto Streamdeck controller

A controller for the elgato streamdeck that uses an event loop to abstract
away the external control from the device making development easier.

## Folder structure

The idea for the folder is that there has to be a `root.json` folder config inside
the `./src/config/streadeck` folder which is the root button entry point.

This then has a structure to allow it traverse the folder tree.
